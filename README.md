### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Some Simple SPOOKY Data Analysis
+ This project is conducted by Huijun Cui
+ Project summary: This project concentrate on text mining of the three author:Edgar Allan Poe(EAP), HP Lovecraft(HPL), Mary Shelley(MWS). During the process, I make analysis like data cleaning, data visualization, sentenmentla analysis, frequency analysis, correlation analysis, bigram analysis and topic modeling. The results show that generally authors have similar tendency in stop word using, but typically EAP like to utilize stop words more than other two authors(especially in the example of word ‘the’). But for non-stop-word, MWS  contribute more than them. Besides, the three authors show different emotional statement and styles(MWS ia more enthusiastic while the other two are more calm), even if they all seem to be negative.
